üß† CLASS INHERITANCE ‚Äî EXPLAINED
===============================================

üß± class:
    A template/blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

üß¨ extends:
    Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another.
    `Teacher extends User` ‚Üí now Teacher gets access to everything in User.

üîë super():
    Calls the parent class‚Äôs constructor.
    Must be called **before** accessing `this` in the child constructor.

üß™ instanceof:
    Used to check whether an object belongs to a class (including inherited classes).

Example:
    teacher1 instanceof Teacher  -> true
    teacher1 instanceof User     -> true
    user1 instanceof Teacher     -> false

| `class`             | Blueprint for creating objects                                              |
| `extends`           | Allows a class to inherit from another                                     |
| `super()`           | Calls the parent class constructor (must be called before `this`)          |
| `instanceof`        | Checks if an object is an instance of a class or its parent                |
| Inheritance         | Lets child classes reuse and extend functionality of parent classes        |

‚ú® Benefits of inheritance:
- Code reuse (don‚Äôt repeat shared logic)
- Clear structure and relationship
- Easier maintenance
